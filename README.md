# ToDo-app

Todo List is a list of things you need to do or want to do.

Traditionally, they are written on a piece of paper and organized in order of priority. When a task is completed, it is usually crossed off the list.

But such a list can be kept not only on a piece of paper, but also in electronic form, for example, in a browser.

## Local storage

LocalStorage is a property that allows JavaScript sites and apps to save key-value pairs in a web browser with no expiration date. This means the data stored in the browser will persist even after the browser window is closed.
